## tl;dr
A collection of mini tools I use which may assist other project managers

## Purpose

As project managers, we employ various techniques and tools to streamline our work.
While we are familiar with well-known resources like PRINCE2, PMBOK, SCRUM, SAFe, etc.,
our day-to-day activities often call for personalized planning, organization, documentation,
review, problem-solving and communication. In this post series, I will share valuable tips
and tools that have consistently proven effective throughout my career.

Each tool, tip or technique has files in a numbered folder.
